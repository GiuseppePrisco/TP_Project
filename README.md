# Topics in Physics Course Project

This repository contains the projects developed for the Topics in Physics course. The projects consist of two presentations on major topics in physics: Wave-Particle Dualism and Dense Coding and Teleportation.

## Wave-Particle Dualism

The first presentation explores the concept of wave-particle dualism, a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics. This principle states that every elementary particle exhibits both particle and wave properties. A particle can be described in terms of particle-like or wave-like characteristics, and different behaviors can be observed depending on the experimental framework.

## Dense Coding and Teleportation

The second presentation dives into the topics of dense coding and teleportation. Dense coding is a quantum communication protocol that allows the transmission of classical information through previously shared quantum entanglement. Teleportation, on the other hand, is a protocol that transfers the state of a quantum system from one location to another, without the physical transportation of the system itself.

Please refer to the individual files in this repository for more detailed information about each presentation.
